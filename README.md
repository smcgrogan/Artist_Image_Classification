# Artist_Image_Classification

In this project, we focus on developing an image classification model to categorize
images of paintings into ten artist categories using the WikiArt dataset. We explore a
comprehensive set of features, ranging from simple features such as Color Histograms and
Histogram Oriented Gradients (HOG), to more complex features, such as Bag of Visual Words
(BOVW) and ResNet18. We perform Principal Component Analysis to reduce the
dimensionality of our dataset, which reduces overfitting, increases generalizability, and increases
model efficiency. We capture our results in two classification models, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), and Linear Regression (LR).
